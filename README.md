This Java program reads all text files from a specific directory and returns word statistics using a GUI. The user can input a directory path and choose whether to include subdirectories.
The program then searches for all text files that reside in that directory and its subdirectories. While the program is processing text files, 
it displays the file names and the up-to-date statistics.
The program uses the JFileChooser class to allow the user to select a directory. It then uses the File class to search for all text files in the directory and its subdirectories.
The JCheckBox class is used to allow the user to choose whether to include subdirectories.
The JButton class is used to trigger the analysis of the directory. The JTextArea class is used to display the output.
